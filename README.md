# infinite-firebase

React component to display infinite lists from Firebase Realtime Database.

A basic [DEMO](https://tarikhuber.github.io/infinite-firebase/)
In the demo you can add as many rows as you want and "try" to scroll to the end (if you have so much time). You can also change and delete single rows to see how the library behaves in such situations

It is "firebasy" and supports realtime changes, deletions and additions. 

Features:
* realtime changes
* realtime deletions
* realtime additions
* sorting via key

For now it doesn't support filtering or sorting by value. But I'm working on it :)

Don't forget that this is still a pre-release so that the API can have breaking changes in very short timelines.

Any kind of help and suggestions are welcome :)
